# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset 🚢

## 📌 Internship Task Overview

This project is part of my data science internship tasks and focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The primary goal is to understand the dataset better, clean the data, visualize trends and correlations, and derive meaningful insights that can support predictive modeling in later stages.

## 🗂 Dataset Information

- **Dataset:** Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster  
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- **Description:** The dataset provides information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived the disaster.

## 📊 Key Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading** – Importing dataset and inspecting structure.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data.
3. **Univariate Analysis** – Exploring individual features (like Age, Sex, Pclass).
4. **Bivariate Analysis** – Examining relationships between variables (e.g., survival vs age).
5. **Visualization** – Using plots to find patterns and outliers.
6. **Feature Engineering (Basic)** – Creating new variables like FamilySize, IsAlone.
